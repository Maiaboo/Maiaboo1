# This code will prompt the user to enter a host to be scanned, then it will retrieve the IP address for that host using the gethostbyname() function.
The code then loops through all ports from 1 to 65535 and attempts to connect to each port using socket.connect_ex(). 
If the connection is successful, it means that the port is open and the code prints a message indicating that the port is open.
Note that this is a very basic port scanner and may not be effective against certain types of targets or in certain network configurations.
It is important to use port scanning tools responsibly and with permission from the target network's owner. #
